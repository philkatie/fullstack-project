# The Process

Right now I'm going to take notes of the process as I go to sort of document my workflow. Not sure if I'll leave this in or even let it get committed, but it seems better to be more thorough than less! If you are somehow reading this please know that I am not usually quite THIS thorough with documentation but I'm really excited about Sure and this interview so I need a method to streamline my thoughts. Also omg just noticed the folders are an "interview/sure" portmanteau pun, incredible.

## Dependency Installation

Installed Django, fought with MacOS/Path/pyenv to upgrade Python from 3.9 to 3.10 (big shoutout to StackOverflow), installed Poetry, ran poetry install.
Ran npm install.
Loaded the local servers to make sure they ran, success, did a quick Hello World edit on the front end for proof of life.

## Whiteboarding/Wireframing

Oh god I'm going to be annoying and make a Trello board aren't I
Update yeah I did

## Basic Frontend Stuff

Installed Bootstrap and got a super basic frontend with header, footer, form going so my brain would quiet down.

## Basic Backend Stuff

It's been a minute since I've done a Django project so I spent a little time in the afternoon refreshing my memory, then started getting some of the basic info for the model and REST framework set up. Then I started thinking of a dozen different things I could do with the theming to make it sillier and more consistent so I had to remind myself that it has to actually work first and then I can make it as goofy as I want.

## Update

Fought with corsheaders for an unreasonable amount of time, figured out it was one of my chrome extensions making it angry. Started fighting with Axios, decided to put it off for a bit. Helped a friend move, I am So Tired And My Body Hurts. Gonna make the form actually work now and then I'll fight with Axios some more.

## Update Again

Okay we're back. I made a new branch and started the backend again with, like, Less Stuff, and it worked completely fine the way I thought it should. So now I'm gonna go back through this branch and find the Problem Child, Fix It, and make everything pretty hooray

## Axios Booo

For some reason I can get Axios to work on my other branch but not this one ? I can't figure out what I've done differently but I keep getting a request failed status code over here. So I'm going to move everything over to that branch, I guess?

## Round 2 (3?)

Okay we are back with the note taking. The app works, and it looks fine ish when the css is persisting. I have a lot of tweaks I want to do tomorrow after I finish helping my friend move but I am nearing the point where I would not be embarrassed to turn this in. I want to change the model a little bit to fit the theme better or at least make the naming conventions more consistent but I simply don't think I can make any more migrations. Gonna get to put a "challenges" section on the final ReadMe I guess, so I've got that going for me which is ???

# Hello again

Helped my friend with Day 2 of his move, genuinely cannot move my body anymore. Going to be in my desk chair forever. Please send help
