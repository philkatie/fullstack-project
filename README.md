# The Process

Right now I'm going to take notes of the process as I go to sort of document my workflow. Not sure if I'll leave this in or even let it get committed, but it seems better to be more thorough than less! If you are somehow reading this please know that I am not usually quite THIS thorough with documentation but I'm really excited about Sure and this interview so I need a method to streamline my thoughts. Also omg just noticed the folders are an "interview/sure" portmanteau pun, incredible.

## Dependency Installation

Installed Django, fought with MacOS/Path/pyenv to upgrade Python from 3.9 to 3.10 (big shoutout to StackOverflow), installed Poetry, ran poetry install.
Ran npm install.
Loaded the local servers to make sure they ran, success, did a quick Hello World edit on the front end for proof of life.

## Whiteboarding/Wireframing

Oh god I'm going to be annoying and make a Trello board aren't I
