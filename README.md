# The Process

Right now I'm going to take notes of the process as I go to sort of document my workflow. Not sure if I'll leave this in or even let it get committed, but it seems better to be more thorough than less! If you are somehow reading this please know that I am not usually quite THIS thorough with documentation but I'm really excited about Sure and this interview so I need a method to streamline my thoughts. Also omg just noticed the folders are an "interview/sure" portmanteau pun, incredible.

## Dependency Installation

Installed Django, fought with MacOS/Path/pyenv to upgrade Python from 3.9 to 3.10 (big shoutout to StackOverflow), installed Poetry, ran poetry install.
Ran npm install.
Loaded the local servers to make sure they ran, success, did a quick Hello World edit on the front end for proof of life.

## Whiteboarding/Wireframing

Oh god I'm going to be annoying and make a Trello board aren't I
Update yeah I did

## Basic Frontend Stuff

Installed Bootstrap and got a super basic frontend with header, footer, form going so my brain would quiet down.

## Basic Backend Stuff

It's been a minute since I've done a Django project so I spent a little time in the afternoon refreshing my memory, then started getting some of the basic info for the model and REST framework set up. Then I started thinking of a dozen different things I could do with the theming to make it sillier and more consistent so I had to remind myself that it has to actually work first and then I can make it as goofy as I want.

## Update

Fought with corsheaders for an unreasonable amount of time, figured out it was one of my chrome extensions making it angry. Started fighting with Axios, decided to put it off for a bit. Helped a friend move, I am So Tired And My Body Hurts. Gonna make the form actually work now and then I'll fight with Axios some more.
